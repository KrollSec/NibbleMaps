# NibbleMaps Content & Marketing Strategy

Comprehensive guide to optimizing your website content and driving conversions.

## Content Philosophy

Your website copy should follow these principles:

1. **Clear over Clever** - "Track Your Food Journey" beats "Your Culinary Compass"
2. **Benefits over Features** - "Never forget an amazing meal" vs "GPS-enabled location tracking"
3. **Active Voice** - "Discover new spots" not "New spots can be discovered"
4. **Conversational Tone** - Write like you're talking to a friend about food
5. **Scannable Format** - Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headers
